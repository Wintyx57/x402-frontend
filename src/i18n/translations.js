      faqQ2: "Is there a minimum payment amount?",
      faqA2: "No minimum. Most native APIs cost between $0.005 and $0.02 per request. Third-party APIs set their own prices.",
      faqQ3: "How fast are transactions?",
      faqA3: "Base transactions finalize in ~2 seconds. SKALE transactions are instant and free. Payment verification happens immediately after on-chain confirmation.",
      faqQ4: "Can I get a refund?",
      faqA4: "Payments are final once on-chain. If an API fails to deliver after payment, contact the provider directly or report it via GitHub.",

      howItWorksPara1: "x402 Bazaar utilise un modèle simple de paiement par appel. Chaque requête API coûte un petit montant fixe en USDC. Pas de frais d'installation, pas d'abonnements mensuels, pas de frais cachés. Vous payez uniquement ce que vous utilisez.",
      howItWorksPara2: "Quand votre agent appelle un endpoint payant, le serveur répond avec HTTP 402 et le prix exact. Votre agent envoie ce montant via transfert USDC sur Base ou SKALE, puis réessaie avec preuve de paiement. L'accès est accordé instantanément après vérification on-chain.",
      keyBenefit: "Pourquoi payer par appel ?",

      faqQ2: "Y a-t-il un montant minimum de paiement ?",
      faqA2: "Aucun minimum. La plupart des APIs natives coûtent entre $0.005 et $0.02 par requête. Les APIs tierces fixent leurs propres prix.",
      faqQ3: "Quelle est la vitesse des transactions ?",
      faqA3: "Les transactions Base sont finalisées en ~2 secondes. Les transactions SKALE sont instantanées et gratuites. La vérification du paiement se fait immédiatement après confirmation on-chain.",
