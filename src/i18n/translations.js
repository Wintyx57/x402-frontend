      sectionTechnical: "Technical",
      sectionProviders: "For API Providers",
      q1: "What is x402 Bazaar?",
      a1: "x402 Bazaar is an autonomous API marketplace where AI agents discover, pay for, and consume services using the HTTP 402 protocol. Payments are made in USDC on Base or SKALE — no accounts, no subscriptions.",
      q2: "Do I need a crypto wallet to use it?",
      a2: "Yes, you need a wallet with USDC on Base (or SKALE for zero-gas). You can use MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or any EVM-compatible wallet. For AI agents, we recommend the Coinbase SDK for programmatic payments.",
      q3: "Is x402 Bazaar free to browse?",
      a3: "Yes! Browsing the marketplace, reading documentation, and exploring services is completely free. You only pay when your agent actually calls a paid API endpoint.",
      q4: "What currency do I pay in?",
      a4: "All payments are in USDC (USD Coin), a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar. This ensures predictable pricing — $0.005 always costs exactly $0.005.",
      q5: "How much does it cost?",
      a5: "Most native APIs cost between $0.005 and $0.05 per request. Community APIs set their own prices. There are no setup fees, monthly charges, or hidden costs.",
      q6: "What if a transaction fails?",
      a6: "If your USDC transfer fails on-chain, the API won't be called and you won't be charged. If the API fails after a successful payment, contact the provider directly or report it on GitHub.",
      q7: "How do I integrate x402 with my AI agent?",
      a7: "The easiest way is to run 'npx x402-bazaar init' which auto-detects your IDE and installs the MCP server. Alternatively, implement the 402 payment flow manually: call the API, receive 402 with price, pay USDC, retry with tx hash.",
      q8: "Which blockchains are supported?",
      a8: "Base (Coinbase L2) for standard transactions (~$0.001 gas) and SKALE Europa for zero-gas transactions. Both networks support USDC payments.",
      q9: "How do I list my API on the marketplace?",
      a9: "Go to the Register page, fill in your API details, and pay the 1 USDC listing fee on-chain. Your service will appear in the marketplace immediately. Alternatively, use our Python template to create a full x402-compatible API endpoint.",
      q10: "How do I earn money as a provider?",
      a10: "When agents call your API, they pay USDC directly to your wallet address. There are no middlemen or escrow — you receive payments instantly. Set your own price and start earning from day one.",
      sectionMore: "More Questions",
      q11: "Who is behind x402 Bazaar?",
      a11: "x402 Bazaar is an open-source project built for the x402 Hackathon, with the ambition to become the #1 platform for autonomous API commerce by AI agents. The code is public on GitHub.",
      q12: "Can I get a refund?",
      a12: "Payments are on-chain and non-reversible. If an API fails after payment, contact the provider or report the issue on GitHub. We're working on a dispute resolution system for future releases.",
      q13: "How is my data handled?",
      a13: "x402 Bazaar stores minimal data: service listings and payment transactions (on-chain). We don't track user behavior, don't require accounts, and don't sell data. See our Privacy Policy for details.",
      q14: "What about gas fees?",
      a14: "On Base mainnet, gas fees are ~$0.001 per transaction. On SKALE Europa, gas is completely free (zero gas). You can choose your preferred network when configuring your agent.",
      q15: "How is x402 Bazaar different from RapidAPI?",
      a15: "x402 Bazaar is agent-first: no accounts, no subscriptions, pay-per-call with USDC. RapidAPI requires credit cards and monthly plans. We offer 95% creator revenue (vs 75%), on-chain transparency, and native MCP/LangChain support.",
      q16: "Can fully autonomous agents use x402 Bazaar?",
      a16: "Yes! That's our core use case. Agents using Claude (MCP), ChatGPT, LangChain, Auto-GPT, or the CLI can discover, pay for, and consume APIs without any human intervention.",
      q17: "What is the revenue share for API providers?",
      a17: "API providers keep 95% of every payment. The 5% platform fee covers hosting, monitoring, payment processing, and multi-platform distribution (6 integrations).",
      q18: "What is the average API response time?",
      a18: "Our native endpoints average under 2 seconds response time. Community-registered APIs depend on the provider's infrastructure. We monitor all endpoints every 5 minutes and show live status on the Status page.",

      intro1: "For decades, APIs have been locked behind authentication systems designed for humans — API keys, OAuth flows, developer portals, monthly subscriptions. But a new era is emerging: one where autonomous AI agents discover, pay for, and consume services on their own.",
      intro2: "Traditional payment infrastructure doesn't work for agents. They can't sign up for accounts. They can't store credit cards. They can't negotiate contracts. And they certainly can't wait 30 days for a billing cycle to close.",
      intro3: "What agents need is a protocol — a universal language for discovering services, verifying prices, and settling payments instantly on-chain.",

      problemTitle: "The Problem: APIs Weren't Built for Agents",
      problem1: "Modern APIs are designed for humans and companies. They require signups, API keys, billing dashboards, and legal agreements — all friction that prevents autonomous agents from operating freely.",
      problem2: "When an agent needs to call a weather API, it doesn't have an email address to create an account. When it needs to scrape a website, it doesn't have a credit card to enter. When it needs real-time crypto prices, it doesn't want to wait for a monthly invoice.",
      problem3: "Traditional API monetization models fail in an agent-first world:",
      problem4: "API keys are static secrets that require manual rotation and centralized storage. OAuth requires interactive browser flows. Monthly subscriptions assume predictable usage patterns. Rate limits punish innovation instead of rewarding value.",

      solutionMicro: "3. Micro-Pricing Unlocks New Business Models",

      q1: "Qu'est-ce que x402 Bazaar ?",
      a1: "x402 Bazaar est une marketplace API autonome ou les agents IA decouvrent, paient et consomment des services via le protocole HTTP 402. Les paiements se font en USDC sur Base ou SKALE — pas de comptes, pas d'abonnements.",
      q2: "Ai-je besoin d'un wallet crypto ?",
      a2: "Oui, vous avez besoin d'un wallet avec de l'USDC sur Base (ou SKALE pour zero gas). Vous pouvez utiliser MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet ou tout wallet compatible EVM. Pour les agents IA, nous recommandons le Coinbase SDK.",
      q3: "Est-ce gratuit de naviguer sur x402 Bazaar ?",
      a3: "Oui ! Parcourir la marketplace, lire la documentation et explorer les services est entierement gratuit. Vous ne payez que lorsque votre agent appelle un endpoint payant.",
      q4: "Quelle devise pour payer ?",
      a4: "Tous les paiements sont en USDC (USD Coin), un stablecoin indexe 1:1 sur le dollar americain. Cela garantit des prix previsibles — $0.005 coute toujours exactement $0.005.",
      q5: "Combien ca coute ?",
      a5: "La plupart des APIs natives coutent entre $0.005 et $0.05 par requete. Les APIs communautaires fixent leurs propres prix. Pas de frais d'installation, pas de mensualites, pas de couts caches.",
      q6: "Que se passe-t-il si une transaction echoue ?",
      a6: "Si votre transfert USDC echoue on-chain, l'API ne sera pas appelee et vous ne serez pas facture. Si l'API echoue apres un paiement reussi, contactez le fournisseur directement ou signalez-le sur GitHub.",
      q7: "Comment integrer x402 avec mon agent IA ?",
      a7: "Le plus simple est de lancer 'npx x402-bazaar init' qui detecte votre IDE et installe le serveur MCP. Sinon, implementez le flux 402 manuellement : appelez l'API, recevez 402 avec le prix, payez en USDC, renvoyez avec le hash tx.",
      q8: "Quelles blockchains sont supportees ?",
      a8: "Base (Coinbase L2) pour les transactions standard (~$0.001 gas) et SKALE Europa pour les transactions sans gas. Les deux reseaux supportent les paiements USDC.",
      q9: "Comment lister mon API sur la marketplace ?",
      a9: "Allez sur la page Enregistrer, remplissez les details de votre API et payez les frais de listing de 1 USDC on-chain. Votre service apparaitra immediatement. Vous pouvez aussi utiliser notre template Python.",
      q10: "Comment gagner de l'argent en tant que fournisseur ?",
      a10: "Quand les agents appellent votre API, ils paient en USDC directement a votre wallet. Pas d'intermediaires ni d'escrow — vous recevez les paiements instantanement. Fixez votre prix et commencez a gagner des le premier jour.",
      sectionMore: "Plus de questions",
      q11: "Qui est derriere x402 Bazaar ?",
      a11: "x402 Bazaar est un projet open-source construit pour le hackathon x402, avec l'ambition de devenir la plateforme #1 pour le commerce API autonome par agents IA. Le code est public sur GitHub.",
      q12: "Puis-je obtenir un remboursement ?",
      a12: "Les paiements sont on-chain et non-reversibles. Si une API echoue apres paiement, contactez le fournisseur ou signalez le probleme sur GitHub. Nous travaillons sur un systeme de resolution de litiges.",
      q13: "Comment mes donnees sont-elles traitees ?",
      a13: "x402 Bazaar stocke un minimum de donnees : les listings de services et les transactions de paiement (on-chain). Nous ne suivons pas le comportement utilisateur, ne demandons pas de compte et ne vendons pas de donnees.",
      q14: "Qu'en est-il des frais de gas ?",
      a14: "Sur Base mainnet, les frais de gas sont ~$0.001 par transaction. Sur SKALE Europa, le gas est completement gratuit (zero gas). Vous pouvez choisir votre reseau en configurant votre agent.",
      q15: "En quoi x402 Bazaar est different de RapidAPI ?",
      a15: "x402 Bazaar est agent-first : pas de comptes, pas d'abonnements, paiement a l'appel en USDC. RapidAPI demande une carte bancaire et des plans mensuels. Nous offrons 95% de revenu createur (vs 75%), transparence on-chain et support natif MCP/LangChain.",
      q16: "Les agents entierement autonomes peuvent-ils utiliser x402 Bazaar ?",
      a16: "Oui ! C'est notre cas d'usage principal. Les agents utilisant Claude (MCP), ChatGPT, LangChain, Auto-GPT ou le CLI peuvent decouvrir, payer et consommer des APIs sans intervention humaine.",
      q17: "Quelle est la part de revenu pour les fournisseurs d'API ?",
      a17: "Les fournisseurs gardent 95% de chaque paiement. Les 5% de commission couvrent l'hebergement, le monitoring, le traitement des paiements et la distribution multi-plateforme (6 integrations).",
      q18: "Quel est le temps de reponse moyen des API ?",
      a18: "Nos endpoints natifs ont un temps de reponse moyen inferieur a 2 secondes. Les APIs communautaires dependent de l'infrastructure du fournisseur. Nous monitorons tous les endpoints toutes les 5 minutes.",

      whatIsPara1: "x402 Bazaar est la première marketplace API vraiment autonome conçue pour les agents IA. Au lieu des clés API traditionnelles, des abonnements mensuels ou des systèmes de facturation complexes, nous utilisons le protocole HTTP 402 pour permettre un accès pay-per-request avec cryptomonnaie.",
      whatIsPara2: "Les agents IA peuvent découvrir des services, négocier le paiement automatiquement et accéder aux APIs sans aucune intervention humaine. Chaque transaction est vérifiée on-chain en utilisant l'USDC sur les réseaux Base et SKALE, garantissant transparence, confiance zéro et règlement instantané.",
