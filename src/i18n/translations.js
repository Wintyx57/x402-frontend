      sectionProviders: "For API Providers",
      q1: "What is x402 Bazaar?",
      a1: "x402 Bazaar is an autonomous API marketplace where AI agents discover, pay for, and consume services using the HTTP 402 protocol. Payments are made in USDC on Base or SKALE — no accounts, no subscriptions.",
      q2: "Do I need a crypto wallet to use it?",
      a2: "Yes, you need a wallet with USDC on Base (or SKALE for zero-gas). You can use MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or any EVM-compatible wallet. For AI agents, we recommend the Coinbase SDK for programmatic payments.",
      q3: "Is x402 Bazaar free to browse?",
      a3: "Yes! Browsing the marketplace, reading documentation, and exploring services is completely free. You only pay when your agent actually calls a paid API endpoint.",
      q4: "What currency do I pay in?",
      a4: "All payments are in USDC (USD Coin), a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar. This ensures predictable pricing — $0.005 always costs exactly $0.005.",
      q5: "How much does it cost?",
      a5: "Most native APIs cost between $0.005 and $0.05 per request. Community APIs set their own prices. There are no setup fees, monthly charges, or hidden costs.",
      q6: "What if a transaction fails?",
      a6: "If your USDC transfer fails on-chain, the API won't be called and you won't be charged. If the API fails after a successful payment, contact the provider directly or report it on GitHub.",
      q7: "How do I integrate x402 with my AI agent?",
      a7: "The easiest way is to run 'npx x402-bazaar init' which auto-detects your IDE and installs the MCP server. Alternatively, implement the 402 payment flow manually: call the API, receive 402 with price, pay USDC, retry with tx hash.",
      q8: "Which blockchains are supported?",
      a8: "Base (Coinbase L2) for standard transactions (~$0.001 gas) and SKALE Europa for zero-gas transactions. Both networks support USDC payments.",
      q9: "How do I list my API on the marketplace?",
      a9: "Go to the Register page, fill in your API details, and pay the 1 USDC listing fee on-chain. Your service will appear in the marketplace immediately. Alternatively, use our Python template to create a full x402-compatible API endpoint.",
      q10: "How do I earn money as a provider?",
      a10: "When agents call your API, they pay USDC directly to your wallet address. There are no middlemen or escrow — you receive payments instantly. Set your own price and start earning from day one.",

      subtitle: "The autonomous marketplace for AI agents and API services",
      whatIsTitle: "What is x402 Bazaar?",
      whatIsPara1: "x402 Bazaar is the first truly autonomous API marketplace designed for AI agents. Instead of traditional API keys, monthly subscriptions, or complex billing systems, we use the HTTP 402 protocol to enable pay-per-request access with cryptocurrency.",
      whatIsPara2: "AI agents can discover services, negotiate payment automatically, and access APIs without any human intervention. Every transaction is verified on-chain using USDC on Base and SKALE networks, ensuring transparency, trustlessness, and instant settlement.",
      whatIsPara3: "Whether you're building autonomous agents, integrating APIs into your workflow, or monetizing your own services, x402 Bazaar removes the friction between discovery, payment, and access.",

      protocolTitle: "The x402 Protocol",
      protocolDesc: "x402 Bazaar is built on the HTTP 402 Payment Required standard, a rarely-used HTTP status code that was designed for micropayments on the web. When your agent requests a paid API, the server responds with 402 and payment details. Your agent pays via USDC transfer on Base or SKALE, then retries with proof of payment.

      a3: "Oui ! Parcourir la marketplace, lire la documentation et explorer les services est entierement gratuit. Vous ne payez que lorsque votre agent appelle un endpoint payant.",
      q4: "Quelle devise pour payer ?",

      q7: "Comment integrer x402 avec mon agent IA ?",
      a7: "Le plus simple est de lancer 'npx x402-bazaar init' qui detecte votre IDE et installe le serveur MCP. Sinon, implementez le flux 402 manuellement : appelez l'API, recevez 402 avec le prix, payez en USDC, renvoyez avec le hash tx.",
      q8: "Quelles blockchains sont supportees ?",
